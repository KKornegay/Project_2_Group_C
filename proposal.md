Project 2, Group C – “Moneyball?”
Do higher MLB player salaries lead to greater team success?
We are examining MLB team salary data from 1985-2015 to determine whether the highest spending teams achieve the greatest levels of success. The calculations will include:
-	Cost/Win for each team per season -> total team salary/wins
-	Mean league Cost/Win per season -> total league salaries/total league wins
-	Cost/Win for each year’s championship team vs. League median cost per win.
Process: 
1.	Create a Python Flask that generate APIs that allow users to search the datasets we create showing correlations between team salaries and success.
2.	Generate a website with instructions for users to access the APIs, as well as providing access to the charts that we generate.
Resources:
-	HTML/CSS
-	JavaScript
-	SQL
-	Python
Data Sources:
	https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank?select=HallOfFame.csv *
	*additional sources TBD
Charts: 
-	Scatterplot showing average team cost per win/per season
-	Bubble chart representing all 30 champions (from 1985-2015). 
o	Size of bubbles will be representative of championship cost/ team win in relation to league mean of cost/team win.
Questions to be answered:
1.	What was the average cost per team win based on total salaries each season?
2.	How often did yearly champions spend above or below the league mean per win?
