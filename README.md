## <b><div align = "center">Do higher MLB player salaries lead to greater team success?</div></b>

An analysis of MLB team salary data from 1985-2015 was evaluated to determine if the highest spending teams achieve the greatest levels of success. Relationships considered include:
-	Cost/Win for each team per season -> total team salary/wins.
-	Mean league Cost/Win per season -> total league salaries/total league wins
-	Cost/Win for each yearâ€™s championship team vs. League median cost per win.

### Process: 
- [x] Concept design and project planning.
- [x] Create Github Repository.
- [x] Evaluate and obtain data sources.
- [ ] Create databases to archive data.
  - [ ] Create SQL database
  - [ ] Create SQL lite database
  
- [ ] Develop a Python Flask application to create API's enabling users to explore data. 
- [ ] Generate a website with instructions for users to access API's and website content.
- [ ] Design additional web pages containing analysis, charts, interactive experiences, and data allowing users to investigate correlations between team salaries and outcomes.

### Questions to be answered:
1.	What was the average cost per team win based on total salaries each season?
2.	How often did yearly champions spend above or below the league mean per win?
